How to Contribute to project Repository

## Ways to Contribute
Whether you're a developer, or just an enthusiast, there are lots of ways to contribute. Here's a few ideas:

* Fork the project, download the main/master branch to your local desktop and run the project locally. Does it work? Does it do what you'd expect? If not, create an [issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) and let us know

* Comment on some of the project's open issues. Have you experienced the same problem? Know a workaround? Do you have a suggestion for how the feature could be better?

* Find an open issue (especially those labeled help-wanted) and submit a proposed fix.

* Help evaluate open pull requests by testing the changes locally and reviewing what's proposed

## How to Contribute

### General Notes

* The smallest the proposed change, the better. If you'd like to propose two unrelated changes, submit two pull requests.
* The more imformation, the better. Make judicious use of the pull request body. Describe what changes were made, why you made them, and what impact they will have for users.
* If this is your first pull request, review [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
